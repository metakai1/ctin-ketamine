# Ketamine, Trauma, and the Future of Mental Health in Canada  
### Published by the Centre for Trauma-Informed Neuroscience (CTIN)

This repository contains an open-science manuscript examining the neuroscience, ethics, and policy implications of ketamine as a rapid-acting intervention for trauma-related conditions within the Canadian mental-health landscape.

The work synthesizes peer-reviewed research on:

- Ketamine’s glutamatergic mechanism of action  
- Neuroplasticity and mTOR-mediated synaptogenesis  
- Trauma-related cortical and limbic dysregulation  
- Ethical considerations of dissociation and identity  
- Access inequities across Canadian populations  
- Policy tensions between emerging evidence and outdated frameworks  

All material in this repository is released **into the public domain (CC0 1.0 Universal)** to maximize accessibility, reuse, and impact across clinical, scientific, policymaking, and public-education contexts.
