## About This Book

**Ketamine, Trauma, and the Future of Mental Health in Canada** is an open-science manuscript that examines ketamine through the lenses of neuroscience, ethics, and public policy.

This book does not promote ketamine as a cure. It explores what ketamine's effects reveal about trauma, healing, and the systems that shape access to care.

### What You'll Find

- **Chapter 1**: Ketamine's emergence and Canada's mental health landscape
- **Chapter 2**: The neuroscience of ketamine, glutamate, and neuroplasticity
- **Chapter 3**: Trauma as a systems-level problem in Canada
- **Chapter 4**: Ethical dimensions of dissociation, identity, and agency
- **Chapter 5**: Inequities in access shaped by geography, economics, and history
- **Chapter 6**: Policy considerations for modernizing mental health systems
- **Chapter 7**: A vision for evidence-informed, equitable trauma care

**For Clinicians**: This book examines how ketamine challenges assumptions about therapeutic timelines and what its mechanisms reveal about trauma's neurobiology.

**For Policymakers**: It highlights gaps between scientific evidence and regulatory frameworks, and considers what equitable access to emerging treatments requires.

**For Those Living With Trauma**: It offers insight into the biological substrates of healing and the possibility that suffering need not be permanent.
