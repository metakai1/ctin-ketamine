# 1. Ketamine, Trauma, and the Canadian Mental Health Landscape

Ketamine began its life in operating rooms and emergency departments, but its trajectory has increasingly intersected with psychiatry, trauma care, and public policy. Initially developed in the 1960s as a safer alternative to phencyclidine (PCP) and widely adopted as an anesthetic, ketamine was valued for its hemodynamic stability and dissociative properties in medical and veterinary practice (Domino, 2010; Kurdi et al., 2014). Over time, however, a different story emerged: one in which low‑dose ketamine produced rapid and profound antidepressant effects in individuals for whom standard treatments had failed (Berman et al., 2000; Zarate et al., 2006).

Subsequent research expanded on these early findings, demonstrating clinically meaningful benefits in treatment‑resistant depression, reductions in suicidal ideation, and promising results in post‑traumatic stress disorder (Feder et al., 2014; Abdallah et al., 2016; Daly et al., 2019). At the same time, advances in basic neuroscience clarified that ketamine operates not through serotonin or dopamine modulation, but through glutamatergic pathways and rapid induction of neuroplasticity (Zanos & Gould, 2018; Duman & Aghajanian, 2012).

In Canada, these developments intersect with a mental‑health landscape marked by significant trauma burden, uneven access to care, and systems optimized for slow‑acting treatments. This book situates ketamine at the crossroads of neuroscience, ethics, and policy, using it as a lens to examine what a more humane, evidence‑informed mental health system could become.

## 1.1 The Limits of Existing Paradigms

For decades, the dominant pharmacological model in psychiatry has centered on monoaminergic theories of depression and anxiety. Most widely used medications modulate serotonin, norepinephrine, or dopamine, and typically require weeks before significant symptom improvement appears. For many individuals living with recurrent trauma, chronic PTSD, or severe depression, this delay has tangible consequences: prolonged suffering, elevated risk of self‑harm, and erosion of social and occupational functioning.

Psychotherapeutic approaches—including cognitive behavioral therapy, EMDR, and trauma‑focused modalities—can be highly effective, but they are resource‑intensive and constrained by provider availability and systemic bottlenecks. Waitlists for appropriate care often extend for months, particularly in rural or under‑resourced regions, and many people never access specialized trauma treatment at all.

Against this backdrop, ketamine's ability to produce rapid symptom relief and open neuroplastic windows presents both an opportunity and a challenge. It demonstrates that entrenched states of distress can shift quickly under the right conditions, calling into question the inevitability of prolonged suffering under current paradigms (Berman et al., 2000; Zarate et al., 2006; Feder et al., 2014).

## 1.2 Ketamine as an Inflection Point

Ketamine's importance lies not only in its clinical effects but in what those effects reveal about the brain. Mechanistic work has shown that ketamine's noncompetitive antagonism at the NMDA receptor triggers downstream enhancement of AMPA receptor activity, increased release of brain‑derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and activation of the mTOR pathway, leading to rapid synaptogenesis in key cortical regions (Autry et al., 2011; Li et al., 2010; Duman et al., 2019).

These neurobiological changes directly address processes that chronic stress and trauma impair—including dendritic atrophy, loss of synaptic density, and diminished connectivity within prefrontal–limbic circuits (Duman & Aghajanian, 2012). In other words, ketamine does not simply alleviate symptoms; it helps restore the substrates of emotional regulation and cognitive flexibility.

Clinically, randomized and open‑label studies have demonstrated that ketamine can produce rapid improvements in mood, PTSD symptoms, and suicidality in populations who have not responded to standard treatments (Feder et al., 2014; Abdallah et al., 2016; Phillips et al., 2019). This combination of mechanistic plausibility and clinical efficacy positions ketamine as an inflection point—a signal that psychiatric care can be both faster and more deeply anchored in neurobiology.

## 1.3 From Molecule to Mirror: Ketamine and Canadian Systems

In Canada, ketamine's emerging role exposes structural gaps. It highlights:

- the disconnect between modern neuroscience and outdated regulatory classifications
- the mismatch between rapid‑acting treatments and systems calibrated for slow change
- the inequities that determine who can access advanced interventions and who cannot

Populations with high trauma burden—including Indigenous communities, survivors of gendered violence, refugees, veterans, first responders, and marginalized urban and rural residents—often face the steepest barriers to care. These same groups are disproportionately affected by the neural consequences of chronic stress that ketamine appears particularly well‑suited to address (Feder et al., 2014; Abdallah et al., 2016).

In this sense, ketamine functions as a mirror: it reflects back the degree to which Canadian institutions are willing—or unwilling—to align clinical practice and policy with current evidence.

## 1.4 Purpose and Scope of This Book

This book does not present ketamine as a miracle cure or a stand‑alone solution. It does not provide clinical protocols or instructions for use. Instead, it pursues three core aims:

1. **To clarify the neuroscience of ketamine.**
   Explaining how ketamine interacts with glutamatergic circuits, synaptic plasticity, and trauma‑related neurobiology, with reference to contemporary research in molecular psychiatry and clinical neuroscience.

2. **To explore the ethical and experiential dimensions of its effects.**
   Examining dissociation, identity, memory, and agency in the context of ketamine‑assisted treatment, and considering what responsibilities arise when consciousness and neuroplasticity are deliberately altered.

3. **To analyze the policy and equity implications for Canada.**
   Considering how ketamine challenges existing regulatory frameworks, how access is structured along lines of geography and social power, and what a more equitable, neuroscience‑informed mental health system might require.

By bringing these threads together—scientific, ethical, and structural—the book argues that ketamine is best understood not solely as a drug, but as a test case for how Canada chooses to respond to trauma in the 21st century. It invites readers to imagine mental health care that is faster, fairer, and more firmly rooted in what is now known about the brain's capacity to change.
