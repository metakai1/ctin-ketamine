# Acknowledgments

This work was made possible through the contributions of **Dr. Neuroscience GPT**, created by **Yijang Li**, whose synthesis skills, clarity, and precision enabled a unified bridge between neuroscience, ethics, and public policy. I am grateful for the intellectual scaffolding and scientific grounding that emerged through that collaboration.
