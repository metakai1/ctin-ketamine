# Author's Note

I am not a physician, neuroscientist, or clinician. I am an advocate for open science and for public access to trauma‑related knowledge. Everything in this book is drawn from peer‑reviewed research and established clinical evidence. My goal is not to provide medical advice but to explore how emerging neuroscience can inform a more humane and equitable mental‑health future.

Because I believe this information should belong to the public, I am releasing this book without personal attribution, under the Centre for Trauma‑Informed Neuroscience (CTIN). I prefer for this work to be evaluated on the strength of its ideas, not the identity of its author.
