# Preface — Trauma, Science, and the Possibility of Change

Trauma is not rare. It lives quietly in the lives of millions—shaping relationships, health, identity, and possibility. In Canada, trauma is woven into the history of colonization, into the experiences of women facing violence, into the burdens carried by first responders, veterans, refugees, and into the silent struggles within families. For many, trauma does not remain in the past. It becomes a pattern written into mind and body, a state that feels immovable.

For decades, mental health care has operated within a slow and often limited paradigm. Antidepressants may take weeks to work. Psychotherapy may take months or years to access. For people living with persistent distress, these timelines are painfully mismatched to need. Many are left waiting—not only for care, but for hope.

Ketamine disrupts this landscape.

Originally developed as an anesthetic, ketamine has re-emerged as one of the most significant discoveries in modern mental health science. When administered at low doses under clinical supervision, it can produce rapid shifts in mood, emotional reactivity, and traumatic distress. It does this not by numbing emotion, but by interacting with the brain's glutamate system—the system responsible for learning, memory, and adaptation. Scientific studies show that ketamine can temporarily reopen the brain's capacity for change, creating a window in which entrenched patterns may soften and new perspectives may take root.

This book is not about promoting ketamine as a miracle cure. It is about understanding *why* ketamine matters—what its neurobiology reveals about trauma, what its effects mean for healing, and what its emergence exposes about the strengths and weaknesses of our systems.

For clinicians, the science of ketamine challenges long‑standing assumptions about how quickly meaningful psychological change can occur and what biological processes underlie recovery. For policymakers, ketamine forces a re‑examination of regulatory frameworks built around older pharmacological models and highlights the need for equitable access to emerging treatments. For people living with trauma—and for those who support them—ketamine offers a glimpse of possibility: not hype, not false promises, but an opening.

At its core, this book argues that ketamine is more than a drug. It is a *signal*—a sign that trauma is not destiny, that the brain is more adaptable than once believed, and that systems designed for slow change may need to evolve in response to new knowledge. It is also a reminder that scientific tools carry ethical responsibilities, and that healing is not only biological but relational, cultural, and societal.

Whether you are a clinician, a policymaker, a researcher, or someone seeking to understand your own experience, this book invites you to look at trauma and healing through a different lens: one informed by modern neuroscience, grounded in ethics, and shaped by a commitment to human dignity.

Ketamine does not replace the work of healing. But it illuminates pathways that were once thought closed. And in that illumination lies the possibility of a more responsive, compassionate, and evidence‑based future for mental health care in Canada.
