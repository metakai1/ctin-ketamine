# 5. Social Impact and Access: Inequities in Canada's Mental Health Landscape

Ketamine's therapeutic potential exists within a broader societal context, where access to care is shaped by geography, socioeconomic status, institutional policies, and cultural history. While neuroscience highlights ketamine's rapid modulation of trauma‑related pathways, social systems determine who receives such interventions, under what conditions, and with what level of safety and continuity. This section outlines the inequities embedded in Canada's mental‑health care landscape and examines how ketamine's properties intersect with these structural realities.

## 5.1 Geographic Disparities in Access to Care

Canada's vast geography creates significant differences in mental‑health service availability. Urban centers often have relatively dense networks of psychiatrists, psychotherapists, and specialized clinics. Rural and northern communities, by contrast, experience substantial shortages.

### 5.1.1 Limited Specialist Availability

Access to trauma‑informed psychotherapists and psychiatrists is sparse outside major cities. Provincial health systems consistently show longer wait times and fewer specialists per capita in remote regions. This is especially consequential given that ketamine‑assisted therapies, where available, require trained clinicians, controlled environments, and structured integration support.

### 5.1.2 Travel Burden and Treatment Feasibility

Given ketamine's rapid but time‑limited neurobiological effects, timely therapeutic support is vital. Individuals in remote areas may have to travel long distances for sessions, reducing the feasibility of repeated treatments and compromising outcomes.

## 5.2 Economic Barriers and Out‑of‑Pocket Costs

In Canada's publicly funded healthcare system, many essential mental‑health services remain partially or entirely outside provincial insurance coverage. Psychotherapy, specialized trauma care, and ketamine‑based treatments typically fall into this gap.

### 5.2.1 The Cost of Trauma Treatment

Survivors of trauma—particularly those from marginalized backgrounds—often face financial instability linked to disability leave, job loss, caregiving burdens, disrupted education, and accumulated medical expenses. Even moderate out‑of‑pocket costs can pose prohibitive barriers.

### 5.2.2 Ketamine Treatment Cost Structures

While ketamine itself is inexpensive as a molecule, the delivery model is expensive. It often includes medical supervision, psychological support, integration sessions, and specialized clinical environments. Because these components frequently fall outside provincial insurance frameworks, patients typically pay privately. This economic filtering creates a two‑tiered system where ketamine's benefits are available primarily to individuals with disposable income.

## 5.3 Cultural and Historical Barriers to Mental Health Care

Social attitudes toward mental health vary across cultural groups in Canada. For many, stigma remains a significant deterrent to seeking care. This barrier is magnified in communities with histories of medical exploitation or institutional harm.

### 5.3.1 Indigenous Communities and Structural Distrust

Centuries of colonial violence have produced systemic mistrust of state‑run medical institutions. Interventions involving altered states of consciousness may be interpreted through the lens of cultural suppression and forced assimilation. Given that ketamine alters perception, memory, and identity processing, culturally informed consent and community‑led models are ethically essential.

### 5.3.2 Immigrant and Refugee Populations

Many immigrant and refugee communities arrive with trauma linked to war, persecution, or displacement. Yet cultural stigma, language barriers, and unfamiliarity with mental‑health systems impede access. Ketamine's rapid effects may offer unique benefits in crisis contexts, but without culturally attuned support, uptake remains limited.

## 5.4 Regulatory Barriers and Policy Constraints

Ketamine's classification and regulatory framework in Canada reflect historical concerns about misuse, predating contemporary neuroscience. This structural lag creates barriers to equitable access.

### 5.4.1 Outdated Scheduling and Restrictive Authorization

Although ketamine is legal for medical use, its regulatory status imposes administrative burdens that disincentivize clinics and practitioners. This contributes to limited availability despite strong evidence supporting its efficacy in depression and PTSD (Berman et al., 2000; Zarate et al., 2006; Feder et al., 2014).

### 5.4.2 Slow Institutional Adoption

Evidence demonstrating synaptogenesis and rapid antidepressant effects has yet to translate into widespread clinical adoption. This delay reflects institutional caution but also results in avoidable suffering.

## 5.5 Intersection of Trauma Burden and Access Inequities

The populations with the highest trauma burden—Indigenous communities, survivors of gendered violence, refugees, veterans, first responders, and low‑income individuals—are the least likely to access ketamine‑based treatments.

This creates a paradox:

- Ketamine's neuroscience suggests it may be most beneficial for individuals with entrenched trauma circuits, impaired neuroplasticity, and chronic stress exposure.
- Social determinants ensure these same individuals face the steepest access barriers.

As a result, ketamine holds the potential to reduce mental‑health inequities while simultaneously being deployed in a manner that reproduces or deepens them.

Understanding this dynamic is essential for designing ethical, equitable policy frameworks.
